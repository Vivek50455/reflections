What happens when you initialize your repository?
why do u need to do it?
ans:.git file is created when we initialize using git init command.
we create a git repository using this so that we can see histories and more.

//
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
in staging area we can commit the changes that we have made to the file.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
make the changes and use the git add command to to add the changed files in the staging area and only those files can be committed.
if i have changed a file but not added in staging area i can use command revert --hard to go to my working directory and unchange the changed.
i can use git diff --staged to check whats the diff between staged file and previous commit file
